ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Welcome to my Github page. 

My name is My Tran. At university and workplaces, I often worked with data, but I felt like there was a missing piece that I needed for my personal growth. So I decided to take a break and focus on learning new skills: data analysis and visualization.

The more I learned and practiced, the more certain I felt that this was exactly what I was looking for. I love playing with data, making sense of it, telling stories about it, and using it to make better evidence-based decisions. 

I am passionate about using data to help businesses make better decisions and achieve their goals. This is why I want to develop a professional career in business data analytics. I am eager to learn and grow in this field, and I am confident that I can contribute value to organizations.
